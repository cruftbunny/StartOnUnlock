# StartOnUnlock

Do you love learning but just can’t find the time?

Do you suffer from sesquipedalian loquaciousness? 

Do you do the crossword – in pen?

Well you’re in luck you insufferable nerd. 

Let me introduce you to StartOnUnlock, the new app that will help you learn so many new and needlessly complicated words 
that even your friends will want to defenestrate you. 

## But how does it work?

I’m glad you asked.
 
StartOnUnlock runs constantly in the background. Each time your screen turns on, it instantly loads your chosen application.

## The Main Idea

I built this tool as a means to open my favorite learning apps whenever I looked at my phone for no reason. We all do it, 
so why not learn something while we're compulsively checking email?
